# ML-Model-Using-Sampling-Method

> The dataset is initially oversampled in this code to make it more balanced. Following that, five different sample procedures are used: simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, systematic sampling, and multi-stage sampling. The greatest accuracy is then determined by applying 5 models to each of 5 samples. With stratified and systematic samples, the Random Forest classifier achieves the highest accuracy.
